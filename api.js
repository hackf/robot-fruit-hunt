function has_item(field)

// Return the number of different fruit types. Each fruit type might

// many categories as possible.

// Returns the number of fruits you or your opponent have.
// E.g. if get_my_item_count(1) returns 3, you have 3 pieces
// of the fruit 1.

function get_opponent_item_count(type)

// Returns the total number of fruits available for a given

// the players inventories.
function get_total_item_count(type)

// Print out a line of text, for debugging. This text will
// be visible to the author of the bot in the game replays

// Notice: Unlike in browsers, this function only works for strings.
